Hello, here is a repository to send you my vision of clean architecture (firstly on the front, then later on back) in different versions.

For these examples, I chose to use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) based on [React](https://reactjs.org/), but the whole point of this architecture is to be able to use it independently of the frameworks and libraries used (external dependencies).

In order to have a simple example, I chose a simple subject: a todo list!

To see the tasks that still need to be done on the project, go to the /docs/todo.md file

If you have any questions, suggestions or anything else, don't hesitate to contact me!
And if this repository has helped you, consider sharing it with your acquaintances.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
# or

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To start unit tests:
